# BluetoothTestApp
App to test/debug basic sending and receiving of messages via bluetooth. 

This app was created to test the bluetooth functionality of another app I was making. 

Many areas can be improved, but it works for now. Was also good practice to learn how android bluetoothSockets worked.
